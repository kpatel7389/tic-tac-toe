## Configuring the Project

Configuring the Xcode project requires a few steps in Xcode to get up and running with iCloud capabilities. 

1) Configure each Mac and iOS device you plan to test with an iCloud account. Create or use an existing Apple ID account that supports iCloud.

2) Configure the Team for each target within the project.

Open the project in the Project navigator within Xcode and select each of the targets. Set the Team on the General tab to the team associated with your developer account.

3) Change the Bundle Identifier.
